To Do:
- [x] link to firebase
  - [x] clear out after live poem is completed
  - [x] have a 'live' collection that builds the poem
  - [x] have a 'poems' collection that has an array of the actual poem sequence
    - [3, 1, 5, 3, 'break', 3, 1, 'break', 2, 1, 8] 
- [x] add generation mechanism when pressing spacebar
  - [x] add upload of generated poem to firebase

- [ ] show only one poem for /poems?id=132

- [ ] decide on colours
- [ ] decide on font
- [ ] decide on poem generation rules

- [ ] some indicator that the poem is being created?
- [ ] we need 2 projectors

- [ ] do something when live is deleted in poems.js -- maybe push the old live poem off to a new section? or do a live listen on poems collection to push it in and clear out the container
